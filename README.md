This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to the `calc()` function.  The bug arises from using percentages and fixed units (pixels in this case) within `calc()` without paying attention to the order of operations and the context in which the percentage is evaluated. The solution shows how to address this issue by clarifying units and ensuring the calculation produces the intended result.
