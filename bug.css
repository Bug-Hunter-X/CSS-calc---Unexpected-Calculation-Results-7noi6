The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, using `calc()` with percentages and other units can sometimes lead to unexpected results if the units are not consistent or the order of operations is not carefully considered. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` will subtract 10 pixels from 50% of the *containing element's* width, not 50% of the *browser window* width. Similarly, the order of operations in `calc(100% - 10px + 5%);` will impact the result. If you intend to calculate 100% minus 15%, it may not yield what you expect.
