The primary issue is ensuring consistent usage of units within the `calc()` function and understanding that percentages are relative to the parent container's dimensions.  For reliable results, define the elements whose dimensions affect the calculation.  Avoid ambiguous expressions.

Instead of:
```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

Consider:
```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
/* Or use explicit values if possible */
.element {
  width: 240px; /* 50% of 500px - 10px */
}
```

For more complex calculations, break them down into smaller, clearer steps to make the code easier to read and maintain and reduce the chance of errors.
